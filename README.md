# LLM-Assisted Hardware Design Portfolio

A collection of AI/ML hardware design projects demonstrating how modern LLM tools can accelerate the development of specialized computing architectures. This portfolio focuses on CNN acceleration through parallel processing arrays and explores various aspects of hardware design for machine learning workloads.

> **Note**: This portfolio represents an experiment in LLM-assisted hardware design. The methodologies and results documented here contribute to understanding how AI tools can enhance traditional hardware design workflows while maintaining engineering rigor and verification standards.

> **Disclaimer**: This project extensively leverages LLM assistance for code generation, design exploration, and documentation as part of a methodology study in AI-assisted hardware design.

## üéØ Project Overview

This portfolio documents my journey through ECE 510: Hardware for AI/ML at Portland State University (Spring 2025), exploring the intersection of hardware design and artificial intelligence. The core focus is developing specialized hardware accelerators that outperform software implementations for CNN workloads.

### Core Design: Parallel Matrix Processing Array

My design process began with benchmarking of CNN workloads using AlexNet to identify performance bottlenecks. As expected, matrix multiplication operations emerged as the primary computational constraint, leading to the development of a **broadcast-based parallel processing architecture**.

**Key Innovation**: Rather than implementing complex systolic arrays, I developed a simpler broadcast-based architecture where input vectors are distributed simultaneously to all processing elements (PEs). Each PE independently computes one element of the result matrix using dedicated MAC units, prioritizing simplicity and predictable timing.

### üèÜ Key Achievements

- ‚úÖ **Two Complete ASIC Implementations**: 8-bit E4M3 floating-point (2√ó2) and 8-bit integer (3√ó3) matrix processors
- ‚úÖ **Full ASIC Flow**: RTL to GDSII using OpenLane 2 for both designs  
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Verification**: Custom testing framework with assertion-based verification and waveform analysis
- ‚≠ê **Performance Validation**: Achieved 3.2x speedup over optimized software baselines
- üß† **LLM-Assisted Methodology**: Demonstrated effective use of AI tools throughout the entire design process

## üìÅ Project Structure

### Setup and Environment

Before exploring individual projects, set up the Python environment:

```bash
# Clone with submodules
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:reecewayt/llm-assisted-design-portfolio.git
cd llm-assisted-design-portfolio

# Set up Python environment and install dependencies
source ./setup.sh

# To update packages later
./setup.sh --update
```

The setup script creates a Python virtual environment and installs all necessary packages for CNN benchmarking and analysis tools.
